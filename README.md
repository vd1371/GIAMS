GIAMS - General Infrastructure Asset Maangement Systems

Given the importance of maintaining infrastructure assets, asset management at both project- and network-levels has been the focus of hundreds of studies. Although these studies and previously developed asset management systems have pushed the boundaries of this field, these advances have been made separately without the ability to build upon one another. This paper puts forward the first open-source, extensible, freely accessible, and modular platform developed in Python, GIAMS, paving the way for researchers and practitioners to easily collaborate and contribute to future related research. Drawing upon related literature, this paper describes modules of GIAMS and illustrates their use with bridge components and models. One project-level lifecycle optimization and one network-level project-selection based on the Indiana, US, bridge network with more than 4,600 bridges are provided to demonstrate the applicability of GIAMS. The modular and open-source nature of GIAMS makes it readily capable of further extension in a variety of asset management topics.
